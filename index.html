        <h4 class="section-heading">Philosophy</h4>
        <p class="section-content">
          We are a child directed, play based program. Our philosophy is based on the idea that children develop best when provided with a variety of interesting choices, and then are allowed to linger and play with what they are interested in. We designed our classroom using the open structured nursery school model. In this curriculum structure, there is a block area, a playhouse area, a puzzle area, a book area, an art area, and a messy area with paints, play dough and other sensory activities.  The children are free to wander from area to area, exploring and playing wherever they choose and staying there until they feel a sense of completion.  We have optional projects always available. We mold our curriculum topics to the children’s interests by allowing them to help choose the themes that we explore. We tailor activities and projects to the individual developmental needs of each child.

          We also believe that nature is a secondary classroom, where children can develop fine and large motor skills by exploring, digging and climbing. Therefore we incorporate plenty of outdoor time, in the garden, at the park, and on regular field trips.

          We also provide personalized academics to help ensure each child is prepared for kindergarten, such drawing and writing projects, daly journaling, as well as science, math and cooking Projects.

          We practice positive reinforcement and focus on emotional connections, and use a non-punitive teaching style. We strive to create long lasting connections with children and families. “It takes a village” and we want to be a central part of your community and always work to bring families together.

          We provide morning and afternoon snacks consisting of fresh fruits and veggies and whole grain cereal and crackers.

          Please inform us of any allergies or food restrictions your child has. 

          Lunches (except Wednesdays) are proved by Parents.
